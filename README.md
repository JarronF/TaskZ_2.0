# TaskZ_2.0
Version 2.0 of a simple Task management application. Allows one to enter various tasks and subtasks for completion.
#### Roadmap (v 2.0):
* Modular
* All non-UI code should be situated in a class library.
* Use Web API to expose data.
* Ability to add various stand alone UI frontend projects (MVC, RazorPages, Angular), and call the API
* Use Dapper for data access (possibly use separate Entity Framework DB for Identity)
